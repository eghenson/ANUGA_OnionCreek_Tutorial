    "The goal of this Notebook is to give users an introduction to some of the basic functionality of the **ANUGA** hydrodynamic model. This model solves the 2D shallow-water equations on an **unstructured triangular grid**, and offers some key advantages over other models for modeling the hydrodynamics of Earth systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a simple, small, coarse model of the **Onion Creek Watershed**. Different cell blocks will demonstate how one can build the model mesh, initialize the domain, setup the parameters of the model, and run the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this script is not to build the best model we can of the domain, but rather to **demonstrate the workflow** of constructing a model that can be modified or replicated for other (better) models. \n",

    "These notebooks are written in Python 3, and have been designed to run in the Google `colaboratory` environment, which provides a Jupyter notebook environment running on a virtual machine on the cloud. Nothing needs to be installed locally, as it is entirely run on Google Drive. All you need is a Google account. All of these scripts are stored on GitHub, which is a platform for sharing open-source codes.\n",
