Instead, it's recommended to use the built-in `inlet_operator` to add the right amount of mass to the model every time-step, and to make the surrounding boundaries **reflective**.

We **save information** on the model's converved quantities (`xmomentum`, `ymomentum`, `stage`) into the output file every `yieldstep`, here set to every **900 seconds** (15 minutes). This **isn't the same thing as the *timestep***: the actual timesteps the model takes are decided by ANUGA based on **stability conditions**, which depends on the spacing of the mesh, speed of the flow, and other numerical mumbo-jumbo. We use the command `domain.print_timestepping_statistics()` to tell us some summary statistics of these timesteps every `yieldstep`.\n",
        "\n",
        "This loop also enables us to **make changes to our model** as time progresses, if we wish. In this example, we update discharge and wind speed (if turned on) within the evolve loop. To do this, we simply modify the attributes of the discharge and wind objects we created earlier. For each of these functions, we use the value _centered_ in each time window between this yieldstep and the next (i.e. `t + savefreq`). Notice that we do not have to modify the tide or rainfall forcings here -- those were defined using functions of time, so they are automatically updated every time-step. "
